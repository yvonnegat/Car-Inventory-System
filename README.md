# 🚗 Car Inventory System Simulation

A graphical desktop simulation created using Python’s `turtle`, `tkinter`, and custom modules to visualize an inventory of randomly generated cars — including **saloons**, **SUVs**, and **trucks**. Each vehicle is rendered with varying sizes, styles, and colors, simulating a dynamic and engaging vehicle inventory system.
